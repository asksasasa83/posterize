Semantic Style Transfer

Semantic Segmentation - [Sharpmask](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deepmask)
Style Transfer - [Texture Nets](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/texture_nets)

## Key Objective

Get the style transfer to work especially well on face images and self-portraits (selfies).

I use the LFW dataset to train the Texture Net hoping that it learns a face prior.
